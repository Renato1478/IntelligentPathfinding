# Intelligent Pathfinding

This repository showcases various search algorithms implemented in Python, with a specific focus on A-star algorithm, a powerful heuristic-based search algorithm. These algorithms are designed to efficiently explore problem spaces, find optimal solutions, and navigate complex environments.

## Algorithms Included

- Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explores a graph or grid by expanding the nodes in a level-by-level fashion, ensuring that all nodes at a certain depth are visited before moving deeper. It uses a FIFO queue and guarantees the shortest path when all step costs are equal.
- Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores a graph or grid by going as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking. It uses a LIFO stack and may not guarantee the shortest path.
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS): Explores a graph or grid by prioritizing nodes with the lowest path cost. It uses a priority queue and guarantees the optimal path regardless of step costs.
- A-star (A*): A heuristic-based algorithm that intelligently searches through a graph or grid by evaluating the cost of reaching a goal from a given node. It combines the use of a heuristic function and a cost function to guide the search towards the most promising paths.

## Features

- Implementation of A-star algorithm in Python, featuring customizable heuristics and cost functions.
- Support for different problem domains, including pathfinding, optimization, and problem-solving.
- Visualization capabilities to observe the search process and the discovered paths.
- Modularity and extensibility, allowing easy integration with other search algorithms and problem-specific extensions.
