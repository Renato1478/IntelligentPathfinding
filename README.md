## Algorithms Included

- A-star: A heuristic-based algorithm that intelligently searches through a graph or grid by evaluating the cost of reaching a goal from a given node. It combines the use of a heuristic function and a cost function to guide the search towards the most promising paths.

## Features

- Implementation of A-star algorithm in Python, featuring customizable heuristics and cost functions.
- Support for different problem domains, including pathfinding, optimization, and problem-solving.
- Visualization capabilities to observe the search process and the discovered paths.
- Modularity and extensibility, allowing easy integration with other search algorithms and problem-specific extensions.
